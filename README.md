## RootConfig
After you run the game once, a `CameraPlus.ini` file is created within the folder Beat Saber\UserData. This file controls profile switching between menu scenes and game scenes.
Edit that file to configure Profile change:

| Parameter                   | Description                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ProfileSceneChange**      | When set to True, profile switching is enabled in the Menu scene and Game scene.             |
| **MenuProfile**             | Enter the profile name to be read in the Menu scene.                                         |
| **GameProfile**             | Enter the profile name to be read in the Game scene.                                         |

## Movement Script
The sample script described in MovementScriptPath is located in the Beat Saber \ UserData \ CameraPlus \ Scripts folder.

### If ActiveInPauseMenu is set to false, there is a bug that the script doesn't return to its original state when SteamVR screen is displayed. 
```xml

## For developers

### Contributing to CameraPlus
In order to build this project, please create the file `CameraPlus.csproj.user` and add your Beat Saber directory path to it in the project directory.
This file should not be uploaded to GitHub and is in the .gitignore.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <!-- Set "YOUR OWN" Beat Saber folder here to resolve most of the dependency paths! -->
    <BeatSaberDir>E:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber</BeatSaberDir>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

If you plan on adding any new dependencies which are located in the Beat Saber directory, it would be nice if you edited the paths to use `$(BeatSaberDir)` in `CameraPlus.csproj`

```xml
